# High Performance Computing

This project was created as part of the University of Warsaw's High Performance Computing course.

The repository contains a CUDA implementation of a GPU-optimized Brandes algorithm to calculate the betweenness of all vertices of a graph. The implemented algorithm is inspired by [A Faster Algorithm for Betweenness Centrality](http://snap.stanford.edu/class/cs224w-readings/brandes01centrality.pdf) and [Betweenness Centrality on GPUs and Heterogeneous Architectures](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.301.6142&rep=rep1&type=pdf) papers.
